# Customer Churn Prediction using ANN (Deep Learning)

## Overview

This project implements an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to predict customer churn in a business setting. The model is trained using deep learning techniques to classify whether a customer will leave or stay based on various features.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of customer-related attributes, including demographic and transactional details. It is preprocessed and fed into the ANN model for training and evaluation.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy

- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed. Recommended version: **Python 3.7+**

### Install Required Libraries

Run the following command to install necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
